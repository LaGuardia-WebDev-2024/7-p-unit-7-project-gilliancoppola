      The Beatles Skiing
    </h1>

   <canvas id="myCanvas" data-processing-sources="myP5Code.pde"> </canvas>
    <div> <p class="text" id="para">In 1965, the movie <em>Help!</em> was released, and it featured the Beatles as the main characters, trying to protect Ringo Starr (the drummer) from an  evil cult leader who wants the powerful <strong> red sacrificial ring</strong> stuck on Ringo's finger.

      <br>

     <br>This scene takes place in the Alps, where the Beatles go skiing. It was filmed in Obertauern, Austria, in March 1965. It was the actual Beatles' first time skiing, so they kind of sucked but it was very funny.

     <br>
    
    <br><strong> Move your mouse on the canvas to bring the Beatles down the ski slope safely so they can escape the cult leader. Ringo is at the front wearing his big red ring.</strong></p>
